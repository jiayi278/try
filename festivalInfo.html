        <p class="description" id="duanwu" style="display: none;">
            
            The Dragon Boat Festival, also known as Duanwu Festival, is a traditional holiday originating from China that is celebrated annually on the fifth day of the fifth month in the Chinese lunar calendar. The festival is marked by various activities and rituals that have been observed for centuries, making it an integral part of Chinese culture and heritage. <br>

            <b class="topic">Significance</b><br>

           The Dragon Boat Festival is celebrated to commemorate the life and death of Qu Yuan, a patriotic poet and minister of the ancient state of Chu during the Warring States period of Chinese history. Qu Yuan was known for his loyalty to his country and his deep love for the people. When his kingdom fell to enemy forces, Qu Yuan drowned himself in the Miluo River as a protest against corruption and tyranny. The local people, who admired him greatly, raced out in boats to rescue him or retrieve his body. To prevent his body from being eaten by fish, they threw <b>rice dumplings</b> wrapped in bamboo leaves (zongzi) into the river. These actions gave rise to the traditions associated with the Dragon Boat Festival. <br>

            <b class="topic">Traditional Rituals</b><br>

            <b class="important">1. Dragon Boat Racing</b><br>The highlight of the festival is the dragon boat races, where teams of rowers paddle ornately decorated boats shaped like dragons. The races are held in rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water. The rhythmic drumming accompanying the races is believed to mimic the heartbeat of Qu Yuan and to drive away evil spirits.<br>

            <b class="important">2. Eating Zongzi</b><br>Zongzi, pyramid-shaped glutinous rice dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves, are a traditional food associated with the Dragon Boat Festival. The fillings can vary but typically include ingredients such as sticky rice, pork, salted egg yolks, and various sweet or savory fillings. Eating zongzi is a way to honor Qu Yuan and to symbolize the rice offerings thrown into the river to feed his spirit.<br>

            <b class="topic">Traditional Rituals </b><br>
            <b class="important"> 1. Fasting and Penance</b><br> Devotees typically observe a period of fasting and purification in the days leading up to Thaipusam as a form of penance and spiritual preparation. Some may abstain from consuming meat and alcohol, while others may maintain a strict vegetarian diet.<br> 

            <b class="important">2. Kavadi Attam (Burden Dance)</b><br> One of the most iconic rituals of Thaipusam is the carrying of kavadis – ornately decorated structures – by devotees as a form of penance and offering to Lord Murugan. These kavadis are often adorned with flowers, peacock feathers, and various decorations and can range from simple wooden structures to elaborate metal frames.<br> 

            <b class="important">3. Piercing and Mortification of the Flesh</b><br>Some devotees engage in extreme acts of devotion, such as piercing their bodies with hooks, skewers, or small spears, as an expression of faith and sacrifice. These acts are believed to demonstrate the devotee's willingness to endure pain and suffering for the sake of spiritual growth and purification.<br> 

            <b class="important">4. Processions and Chanting</b><br> On the day of Thaipusam, devotees gather at temples dedicated to Lord Murugan, where they participate in colorful processions accompanied by music, chanting of hymns, and the beating of drums. The atmosphere is filled with energy and devotion as devotees express their reverence for the deity.<br>
